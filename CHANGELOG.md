# Changelog

## v1.0.0 - Initial Public Release

First clean, single-commit history baseline.

### Highlights
- React + Vite client with interactive Chart.js visualizations.
- Express server with API endpoints for chart data.
- Shared TypeScript + Zod schemas for consistent types.
- Polished chart card UI: hover reveal panel, stable borders, smooth scaling.
- Dependency cleanup and config hardening (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind).
- Repository history squashed to a single curated commit.
- Added README with development, build, and deployment notes.

### Next Ideas
- Deploy static client to Vercel (or fullstack to Railway/Render).
- Add automated tests (unit + UI smoke).
- Harden security & address npm audit vulnerabilities.
- Add CI workflow (lint, typecheck, build) via GitHub Actions.
